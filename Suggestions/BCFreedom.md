# BC Freedom (France)
- "Au pas camarades!" update

## NATIONAL FOCUSES
There will be a balance of power mechanic for BC Freedom.
### Political
There are three initial choices that open up the political tree
- Cooperate with Rena and Ruka (Historical)
    - Democratic branch with Marie as head
    - Can lead to monarch in exile (with Marie) if BC Freedom capitualates
- Let them "sort it out" (Balance of Power moves towards Rena and Ruka)
    - Can lead to a civil war
        - If a civil war breaks out, Monarchy in exile (with Marie) is possible
    - Facist branch if Rena Andou wins
    - (More Agressive) Democratic branch if Ruka Oshida wins
        - Can lead to "democratic" communist Ruka
- Force them to cooperate (Balance of Power moves towards Marie)
    - Monarchy branch with Marie (basically Napoleon)
    - Communist Branches
        - General Council (Syndicalism with Ruka Oshida as head)
        - Facist-Communist hybrid abomination under Rena Andou (via a Coup)
        - Stalinist style communism (with Marie)



## NOTES
- Easter Egg? : Charles de Gaulle "Chad" branch?

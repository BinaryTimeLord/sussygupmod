Inside the Tower, many prisoners were shown to Kilimanjaro including Rosehip, imprisoned for a day for her 600th speeding offense. However, another prisoner was show to Kilimanjaro, called Calvin, or as the prisoner described himself as, St. Gloriana Gaming College. Darjeeling stated that he was an important prisoner and that he was under the custody of St. Gloriana due to the evil nature of his crimes. Although a Koala citizen, Calvin was wanted by many schools for child grooming allegations, exposed by a St. Gloriana citizen under the pseudonym OC Gangsta, which led to his apprehension by Koala authorities. Once the rest of the Commonwealth and Saunders had been notified, only St. Gloriana were willing to take such a vile prisoner, such was their supreme confidence in handling criminals. \n\nArriving at 10 Downing Street, Darjeeling and Kilimanjaro sat down for a cup of tea before moving over to Highbury to watch a football match between Woolwich Arsenal and Manchester United FC. Manchester United Ended up winning 8-2. \n\nReturning to 10 Downing Street, Kilimanjaro stated that..."

 #KAMA PACT
 kmm.52.t: "The Kama Pact"
 kmm.52.d: "Kuromorimine has sent us a proposal for mutual cooperation between our two nations. They have an interest into binding our two nations under one alliance, plus to reopen the Panzerfahren training center in Kama closed down by Maho in the aftermath of the 62nd Tournament.

 #CHT UNION
 kmm.48.t: "One with Emi?"
 kmm.48.d: "Emi Nakasauga, seeing that she is Japanese as well as German, has offered to unify our two nations.

 kmm.47.b: "Maybe Retreating would be better"

 #TRIAL OF THE LOYALISTS
 kmm.46.t: "The Trial of Erika and Maho"
 kmm.46.d: "With the Civil War now over, we have captured both of our former commanders alive. Having repudiated their doctrine in our takeover, they are now no longer of use to us, and as such we have brought them to trial. \n\nPresided over by the Tribunal of Sangou, Mauko and Geshiko, the charges that the two former commanders were 5 pages long, ranging from small misdemeanors such as tardiness to capital crimes such as treason and aiming to undermine Kuromorimine. Many in attendance knew that some of these charges were trumped up, but also knew that some of the charges were well founded. \n\nAs a closing statement, Maho rose up and gave a quickfire speech on how she had done her best to guide Kuromorimine to their elusive 10th victory, and that she had always aimed to treat subordinates and classmates alike with respect and courtesy. She aimed to rebut every single allegation made, but was cut out by an indignant crowd who saw her speech as nothing but excuses. Erika stayed silent, letting her lifelong commander take the lead. \n\nThe trial was concluded and both girls were..."

 #OPERATION ANGLERFISH
 kmm.45.t: "Unternehmen Seeteufel"
 kmm.45.d: "At noon today as the Kommandant reaches to her planning quarters behind frontlines, she was visited by Miho Nishizumi and Hana Isuzu. In this meeting, the two field marshals offered a toast in celebration to the rapid success of Kuromorimine in the vengeful fight against Pravda. All goes well in this meeting as Erika realizes that these two were here for a celebration indeed, one for her death. \n\nIn a test to observe this, she temporarily dismisses the two and lets a bird drink from the glass. Minutes later after stern observation, it dies on a tree seemingly innocently. In a bid for revenge in this realization of assasination by poison, she angrily pours and mixes all glasses with the poison. She switches her own cup with less water to give the traitors a sense of confidence in the Fuhrerin's death. \n\nLater on after dismissal, she recalls the two and cheers them on as they drink the newly poisoned water. The Fuhrerin survives as two fallen genius minds die painfully and slowly only an hour after. A funeral isn't held for them and they are labled dead in combat. \n\nPapers from the investigation report call to this operation as 'Operation Anglerfish' named by Miho Nishizumi, with no utter trace of involvement to the rest of the still alive team. The Fuhrerin now sits in the woods playing a familiar tune on her accordion."
 kmm.45.a: "Deliberate Fools."

 #Kaiserin's Gambit
 kmm.44.t: "A Tea Party Elsewhere"
 kmm.44.d: "In a move to improve our relations with St. Gloriana, we have opted to invite them to a diplomatic tea party to discuss matters on a possible alliance of sorts to handle European hegemonies with regards to its academies and senshadou. \n\nMany more are planned to be insighted in this event but the Kaserin still wonders where to hold the party. It's location to be held will be especially responded upon by BC and Pravda embroiled in their politics. Currently now there are two choices, Frankfurt and Brimingham. Each giving a significant mark to each academy's history. If we opt for Birmingham we will have to use the airship Schawrzburg to get there and if Frankfurt, we'll have Luise Hoffmann and Geshiko to escort [ENG.GetLeader] from London."
 kmm.44.a: "Frankfurt!"
 kmm.44.b: "Birmingham!"
 kmm_news.8.t: "Tea Party at Birmingham"
 kmm_news.8.d: "To much surprise, the airship Schwarzburg has carried with her the honorable Kaiserin=Kommandant of Kuromorimine from Berlin to Birmingham in one trip. \n\nThe purpose of the trip has been to initiate diplomatic talks with St. Gloriana for seemingly a military alliance between the two academies. But all this talk has been overshadowed by the grandeur of the airship's trip to go on with out break while riskily carrying the Kaiserin in her maiden flight. \n\nThere have also been reports of a leak prior to the voyage that had been quickly reapired and patched up before flying; luckily saving the Kaiserin in the way."
 kmm_news.8.a: "Excellent!"
 kmm_news.8.b: "Welcome!"
 kmm_news.8.c: "Well then"
 kmm_news.9.t: "Tea Party at Birmingham"
 kmm_news.9.d: "In a shock to the world, the Kuromorimine Airship, Schwarzburg has blown up in the airspaces of Nord-Pas-de-Calais at 2:30 pm this afternoon. \nIt has been reported that the Kaiserin was onboard the airship and have died, with it the maiden flight to Birmingham. The purpose of the visit was to settle disputes and agreements with St. Gloriana in a friendly virtue of a tea party. But all else has gone wrong with official investigations noting a gas leak from the airship 5 days before its voyage. \n\nMany now point to BC intervention on the airship and Miho has been invited over to take reins of the Kurorreich as stated in Koume's will. Kuromorimine mourns."
 kmm_news.9.a: "..."
 kmm_news.9.b: "Condolences..."
 kmm_news.9.c: "Indeed they do..."
 kmm_news.9.e: "Let them cope."

 #Compiegne Agreement
 kmm.43.t: "Compiegne Restrictions Lifted"
 kmm.43.d: "Clause 3, subsection 1 of the 2nd Compiegene Agreement stipulates the promise of Kuromorimine's lifting of personnel cap restrictions if they maintain inspection requirements as observed by international agents. \n\nIn accords to this, we have proven enough of ourselves to follow this agreement. While of course we'll still find loopholes to this..."
 kmm.43.a: "Surely!"
 
 #Kuromorimine Concessions
 kmm_news.7.t: "Red Dawn"
 kmm_news.7.d: "In a small confrontation against Pravdaist forces along the Bonple-Pravda border, Kuromorimine has decided to intervene and mediate between the two academies for a territorial concesssion in exchange for a Bonple guaranteee. This policy of Pravdaist appeasement serves to satsify and create a new status quo between the two rigid powers and Eastern Europe has become their respective playground. \n\nMany wonder about what this may bring upon the two academies but war is nearing over the horizon as the storms roll over the red dawn on the doorstep of Europe and Asia. It is only a matter of time, as commented by generals Klara and Andou coincidentally."
 kmm_news.7.a: "Tick. Tock."

 #Kebab Kebab Kebab. All I see is that im in a dark room eating kebab
 kmm.42.t: "Kuro Approachment"
 kmm.42.d: "A Kuromorimine delegation has been sent by the Kaiserin-Kommandant on a possible deal with a military alliance to establish ourselves a presence and control over the Mediterranean and to open a front against Pravda in the Caucasus. \n\nThe delegation has also suggested economic and industrial ties through invesments and development projects and the like. With our academy still in the alleyway in many terms, this could mean a step further on the majors' stage. But this will come at the risk of many other things as well."
 kmm.42.a: "Very well."
 kmm.42.b: "We can do on our own for now."

 #MIHO PLAN
 kmm.41.t: "Miho Plan"
 kmm.41.d: "In our war against Pravdaism, we are presented another fiend to our west namely as the new Examination faction have risen up in BC Freedom. While much of general staff have focused its priorities in the East, the venture for Western Europe stands at Miho Nishizumi in elaborating several plans for BC Freedom's capitulation. \n\nMany of our options include the roundabout invasion of BC from the Benelux or just the Ardennes in general. This way could prove to counter BC Freedom's Maginot Line near the Rhine. It would indeed be a gamble to try and pierce their defensive line without any relief. \n\nThis brings us to other resorted plans such as leaving BC in the hands of St. Gloriana as we provide minor mainland offensives against them in the case of landings in Northern or Southern France. \n\nFinally, a wild idea to take on the Examinations by rerouting behind them in the Maginot through paratroopers and attacking them from behind the lines. \n\nWith each having their own set of risks, we shall tread carefully and effectively under Miho's leadership and the Kaiserin's."
 kmm.41.a: "We cannot risk to go against Dutch neutrality."
 kmm.41.b: "We must unleash full force in our elimination process."
 kmm.41.c: "Gloriana should have this covered."
 kmm.41.e: "Let's surprise them."

 #YUGO GUISE
 kmm.40.t: "Kaiserin's Visit"
 kmm.40.d: "As we have expected, the Kaiserin has visited us directly on matters  regarding about foreign affairs. We are presented with a choice of allying with the Kaiserin and staying out of conflict. \n\nWith this we must consider many factors as we bring ourselves to a greater stage in senshadou politics."
 kmm.40.a: "An Alliance with the Kaiserin!"
 kmm.40.b: "We shall bide our time alone."

 #HUNGARIAN QUESTION
 kmm.39.t: "Kaiserin's Visit"
 kmm.39.d: "The Buda Castle staff have been alarmed to witness what seems to be the Kaiserin's sudden arrival there. As she stepped up the stairs of the castle she acts as if she was a regular student entering for normal concerns, wearing casual clothing and having no guards in sight. \n\nShe requests a talk to the regent to discuss diplomatic concerns. When asked for her identity, she presents her academy's identification card as plain as that. She is peacefully guided to the regent's office and the discussion starts here. \n\nKoume presents a map of Europe showing the few eastern countries and kindly asks the regent to consider her diplomatic options. With the regent in sudden realization of to whom she is talking to, she lays silent and stares at the map."
 kmm.39.a: "An Alliance with the Kaiserin!"
 kmm.39.b: "Non-Aggression Pact - We can't interfere in their issues."

 #GREGORIAN QUESTION
 kmm.38.t: "Kaiserin's Visit"
 kmm.38.d: "The Prague Castle staff have been alarmed to witness what seems to be the Kaiserin's sudden arrival there. As she stepped up the stairs of the castle she acts as if she was a regular student entering for normal concerns, wearing casual clothing and having no guards in sight. \n\nShe requests a talk to the president to discuss diplomatic concerns. When asked for her identity, she presents her academy's identification card as plain as that. She is peacefully guided to the president's office and the discussion starts here. \n\nKoume presents a map of Europe showing the few eastern countries and kindly asks the president to consider her diplomatic options. With the president in sudden realization of to whom she is talking to, she lays silent and stares at the map."
 kmm.38.a: "An Alliance with the Kaiserin!"
 kmm.38.b: "Non-Aggression Pact - We can't interfere in their issues."

 #KURO REPUBLIK
 kmm.34.t: "Federal or Unitary?"
 kmm.34.desc: "In the first notes on Kuromorimine democracy, the question has been raised by Koume Akaboshi on the distribution of student council power over the academy. There are two possible paths that the council have presented: the federal system and the unitary system. \n\nThe republican convention convenes its first issue on the table with Mauko voicing on the importances and advantages of a federal system namely in allowing a more independent and flexible chain of power and command. \n\nGeshiko takes her turn on the floor to refer to a more unified and central student council to ensure a quick flow of power and less funding spent on lower chains. \n\nChanging the current system would replace class representatives with class officers. Surely an unorthodox method to the academy. The convention adjourns for break and Koume takes into conclusion her final ammend:"
 kmm.34.a: "Federal Principles are key to integrity."
 kmm.34.b: "Unitary Principles are key to unity."
 kmm.35.t: "Unicameral or Bicameral?"
 kmm.35.desc: "The second issue on Kuromorimine comes to the question on to the legislature composition system. We are provided with two options - unicameral legislature and bicameral legislature. The convention convenes on the issue by noon. \n\nKoume takes the initiative in presenting. She states that a single chamber of congress can make for efficient law making and a great sense of unity in the academy. But she also makes way for the bicameral proposition in backing of checks and balances against dangerous agenda or erroneous legislature with two congressional chambers. \n\nAnother unorthodox ammendment that leads to either having class heads or representatives only in congress or having the rest of the denizens involved. The convention adjournes for 30 minutes and it returns to the conclusion of:"
 kmm.35.a: "Unicameral Congress \nOne assembly - One union"
 kmm.35.b: "Bicameral Congress \nTwo chambers - One house"
 kmm.36.t: "Police or Morals Committee"
 kmm.36.desc: "The final issue in present time is on judiciary responsiblity. Shall it be governed by a police academy force or a morals committee? \n\nThe debate turns rousy as points on elitism, order, and values go on and about. One hour later Koume comes to the final decision to calm the noise in the convention.\n\nShe decides..."
 kmm.36.a: "Academy Police keeps discipline in check."
 kmm.36.b: "Morals Committees keep understanding in check."

 kmm.37.t: "Snap Student Council Election"
 kmm.37.desc: "With our former commanders’ elimination and General Koume’s unwillingness to take control of the nation, a snap StuCo election has been held. \n\nThe First candidate was a well known one, Emi Kojima who famously occupied Maho’s place at a Senshado conference. She was a popular candidate preaching peace and harmony between the big Senshado schools. \n\nThe Second candidate was also well known, but for different reasons. This was Miho Nishizumi, the current commander of Ooarai Girls Academy’s Senshado team. She aims to right the wrongs of the previous tournament but stopped short at revenge against their former enemies. \n\nThe Last Candidate was not the most well known. This was Emi Nakasauga, a German-Japanese mixed child who preached what Miho had said but went further to promise revenge against Kuromorimine’s vanquishers. \n\nThe election was tight, and violence from all sides marred what could’ve been a good show of the new Kuro democracy. However, when the ballots were counted..."
 kmm.37.a: "Emi Nakasauga came out on top"
 kmm.37.b: "Miho came out on top"

 kmm.32.t: "Kuromorimine's Covert Deal"
 kmm.32.d: "A telegram has arrived on Aki's desk presenting a secret offer for us. She opens the wrapped envelope reads it with scrutiny, and with excitement, she rushes to Mika in Helsinki to present an undeclinable offer. Though she isn't there. \n\nShe rushes again to Turku, her favorite calming destination, to see if she's there, but to Aki's dismay and confusion, Mikko was only there to say that Mika has travelled to Tampere, in a very worried tone. Rerouting her personal guard has now sent much students that she meets along the way into confusion. \n\nFinally, she arrives and as she barges into the commander's quarters only to hear from... no one, that... 'Mika is in Helsinki.' \n\nAki immediately pales and leaves the quarter to head for Helsinki, trusting the voice. Rumours have been going on about Jatkosota's White Witch all over even outside the academy - with some saying that she is an old long forgotten student and some even thinking about the **REDACTED** Spirit coming to haunt them all. Though so far no one was hurt. \n\nBack in Helsinki, Aki reaches Mika's office and Mika immediately says 'Accept it.'. It seems like the spirit also got to her as well."

But that stands against the point that they are still Kuromorimine by name and logical observation. \n\nThe matter now stands to us in budging them against their actions in demand and exposement to the sensadou community. We can also take this initiative with St. Gloriana to further legitimize our cause to this blatant violation of Versailles. What purpose is a treaty if it gets disregarded and broken by the other party? BC Freedom must now make a swift decision while Kuromorimine is still mustering its power.

An immediate reaction from within the academy and the Reich has been to petition her to stay. Maho so far has rejected every proposition stating that 'matters in Erka's actions deserve a question on her part to its greatest extent' and in a secret message to her sister, 'if she chooses the realm of insanity she, too, will be what she has created'. As Europe wakes, thousands wonder if this means the end of the totalitarian regime, or a worsening of it. Comments and analysis on her statement have been yet to be received. \n\nThe crisis paramount serves to destabilize nothing so far but brings a sudden foreshadowing to the future in schemes only God knows what. With the question on leadership becoming unclearer by the minute and hour, Kuromorimine faces the next day without a commander.

It seems to be unthinkable at first by most of the military but as Fukuda elaborates further, more and more are swayed to this new doctrine. Fukuda is set out to test this out by taking sweeping action through China and Southeast Asia. \n\nIn contrast, Tamaki Tamada insists on the olden doctrine in which tackles with the same suicide charges as of now. Surprisingly, she is now loosing traction of her own power with Fukuda on the rise. The only way Tamada could prove this olden doctrine is through a push northwards in to Siberia opposing Pravda. \n\nIn the end, it is the Empress-Commander's choice to steer in either direction.

 finland.17.d:0 "Since Jatkosota declared independence in 1917, the most problematic issue of our relations has been our border, located extremely close to one of our most important cities - Katyushagrad. However, our recent negotiations with Jatkosota allow us to move the border and protect the city from a military threat in exchange for a territorial site in Karelia.\nNevertheless, we can still recognize the current border satisfactory, although this will put Katyushagrad in a dangerous position."

Although no formal alliance has been agreed upon between our countries, the Finnish government has asked us for help to support them in the current conflict.\n\nWhile the government remains divided on what steps we should take to help Jatkosota, the public support for their defense is notable.

 jat.5.t:0 "Fascist coup"
 jat.5.d:0 "It seems that the suspicions that the Finnish leadership didn't listen to were true. Yesterday at 3:00 Helsinki time, armed pro-fascist units of the white guard captured Helsinki. The coup was very well planned, and all power in the country is now seized by supporters of the PPM. Now they use detachments of their own armed formations to suppress any resistance to the new government."
 jat.5.a:0 "Glory to Greater Jatkosota!"
 
 jat.6.t:0 "Protests in the capital"
 jat.6.d:0 "It's obvious now that the right's hopes for a quick takeover of power in the country are destined to fail. Despite the fall of the Central government, there were a number of protests across the country, which in some cases resulted in clashes with Pro-fascist forces. Particularly strong actions were held in the capital, and it seems that the protesters don't think to stop."
 jat.6.a:0 "We need to restore order!"
 
 jat.8.t:0 "Civil war"
 jat.8.d:0 "It seems that this was inevitable. Since its seizure of power in the country, the Patriotic people's movement has faced extremely strong resistance to its regime, mainly from the left-wing forces. The response to that was a series of arrests and repressions of social democratic party figures, people dangerous to the regime, and even Mika, which led to even more radicalization of the protesters.\nThis difficult situation was immediately taken advantage of by the Pravda, which doesn't want the establishment of our regime in the country right at its borders. They began sponsoring revolutionaries through all possible channels and forming an underground revolutionary center. Using the strategy of the popular front, the Communists were able to attract to their side not only their supporters, but also many Social Democrats.\nThe revolutionaries revolted in the capital of the country and were able to take control of almost all of our industry. However, not everything is so bad: most of the rebels are poorly armed, and our army with the White Guard have remained loyal to us.\nNow that Jatkosota's fate is hanging in the balance, we must do everything to save our country once again from the communist threat!"
 jat.8.a:0 "For Jatkosota!"
 jat.8.b:0 "Down with the fascist dictatorship! Glory to the revolution!"
 
 jat.9.t:0 "Plot in the army?"
 jat.9.d:0 "After the coup, Mika was away from the main events. Her conflict with the party leadership over their attitude towards the Swedish minority is a matter of concern to many members of our government. Some suggest that we strike preventatively and place Mika and her supporters under arrest before they take something against our power."
 jat.9.a:0 "If She wants to live, She'd better keep her head down!"
 jat.9.b:0 "We'll arrest anyone who opposes us."
 jat.9.c:0 "Maybe an invitation to the government will change her plans?"
 
 jat9a_tt:0 "§RWe won't place Mika under arrest.§!"
 jat9b_tt:0 "§RMika and her supporters will be arrested and shot. This can significantly increase the protests!§!"
 jat9c_tt:0 "§RSupport from Mika may increase the legitimacy of our regime in the eyes of a part of the population, but our ideology will be under attack!§!"
 
 jat.10.t:0 "Mika overthrows the government"
 jat.10.d:0 "No one will ever know what the PPM radicals really wanted to achieve. In the end, their rebellion was doomed to defeat: the opposition to their regime was too strong, both among the people and among the highest circles. Their power fell as quickly and unexpectedly as the previous one. Marshal Mika, who has serious contradictions with the new leadership, using loyal ones, made a counter-coup and put an end to the short-lived rule of Mikko. Using her popularity among the people, he easily secured a strong position as head of state. Gradually, the protests come to naught, and the new government begins to strengthen its regime."
 jat.10.a:0 "So the end of "Great Jatkosota" came."
 
 jat.11.t:0 "Failure of the fascist coup"
 jat.11.d:0 "Yesterday at 3:00 Helsinki time, armed pro-fascist units of the white guard attempted to capture the capital. They were stopped in time by the entered army and surrendered quickly enough. After further investigation by the security forces, an extensive conspiracy was uncovered within the ranks of officers and centered in the Patriotic people's movement. It seems that it began to take shape after the unexpected victory of the Social Democrats in the elections. It's unknown whether there are still any supporters of right-wing radicals in our ranks, but we can say with confidence that we have got rid of the threat of fascism."
 jat.11.a:0 "We're done with fascism."
 
 jat.12.t:0 "No one reaches an absolute majority"
 jat.12.d:0 "As expected, the Social Democratic party failed to achieve an absolute majority in the election, and the Parliament is now divided between several factions, each consisting of less than 50% of the total number of members."
 jat.12.a:0 "As always."
 
 jat.13.t:0 "Coalition government formed"
 jat.13.d:0 "According to the results of the elections, the Agrarian League and National Coalition Party were able to agree on the creation of a coalition government, and it will soon begin to exercise its powers."
 jat.13.a:0 "Nothing special."
 
 jat.14.t:0 "Red restoration"
 jat.14.d:0 "Years have passed since the defeat of the Finnish Red Guard by White troops and German interventionists. Many expected that the hopes of the Communists for a revolution were destined to turn to dust. But everything happened differently. The Finnish bourgeois government was destroyed under the power of the Red Army, and now power is in the hands of the Finnish Communist Party.\n\nThe country is in extreme distress. The destruction caused by the war and the actions of partisan units reached almost every corner of the country, and the population undergoing bourgeois propaganda still doesn't trust the new government."
 jat.14.a:0 "Progress always wins."
 
 jat.15.t:0 "Chaos in Jatkosota"
 jat.15.d:0 "Jatkosota is in chaos. The victory of the Social Democrats in the elections led to a new civil war between whites and reds.\nThe Aland islands, originally captured by the Communists, after their defeat are in a difficult situation. Finnish nationalists hold extreme anti-Swedish positions, and the population, most of which are Swedes, now wants to return to their homeland. What should we do?"
 jat.15.a:0 "The time has come."
 jat.15.b:0 "Too risky."
 
 jat.16.t:0 "Viggen occupies the Aland Islands!"
 jat.16.d:0 "Taking advantage of the plight of our country, these damned Swedish upstarts have broken our borders and occupied the strategically important Åland Islands.\n\nUnfortunately, now we cannot answer them and will have to postpone this problem indefinitely."
 jat.16.a:0 "We'll come back for them..."
 
 jat.17.t:0 "Victory in the civil war"
 jat.17.d:0 "This time everything happened differently. Moving further north every day, we finally defeated the White Guard, and its fascist leaders were forced to flee the country.\n\nNow we can finally say that the Finnish revolution is over."
 jat.17.a:0 "Glory to the revolution!"
 
 jat.18.t:0 "Victory in the civil war"
 jat.18.d:0 "History always repeats itself. As in the past, the Red Guard was defeated, and what was left of it fled to the Pravda.\n\nThe country is gradually being rebuilt, and every day we're getting closer and closer to the great march to the east."
 jat.18.a:0 "Glory to Jatkosota!"
 
 jat.19.t:0 "1937 presidential election"
 jat.19.d:0 "The next finnish presidential election will be held today. Who will take this position?"
 jat.19.a:0 "Mika should extend her term."
 jat.19.b:0 "Aki should be president."
 
 jat.20.t:0 "1937 presidential election"
 jat.20.d:0 "The next finnish presidential election will be held today. Who will take this position?"
 jat.20.a:0 "Jouko should be president."
 jat.20.b:0 "Mikko should be president."
 
 jat.21.t:0 "Early 1940 presidential election"
 jat.21.d:0 "Due to health problems, our current President has resigned, and the next election will be held today. Who will take this position?"
 jat.21.a:0 "Rumi should be president."
 
 jat.22.t:0 "Political crisis"
 jat.22.d:0 "Due to failures at the front, the political crisis begins. The President is forced to resign, and Mika takes over her position."
 jat.22.a:0 "Let's hope for the best..."

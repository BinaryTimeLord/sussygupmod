The exact contents of these consultations are unknown, but it stands to reason that they are connected to the continued frustrations of Erika with the leadership of the party. [GER.GetLeader] still seems to follow the advice of the Wehrmacht when it comes to military matters, blocking Erika's attempts at creating and expanding an independent armed force as a counterweight.\n\nRumor has it that Erika has instead turned her attention towards creating what she calls "a new Order of Teutonic Knights for a new Germany". These "Knights" swear fanatical loyalty and unquestioning obedience to Erika personally and are each gifted a sword made to Erika's design from steel blessed in old Germanic rituals - presumably to slay the enemies of the New Germany."

Over dozens of pages, it details how the SS could use its diminished but still substantial powers to seize control over the government 'in the event that [GER.GetLeader] betrays the national-socialist cause'. Evidence for such a betrayal, the paper continues, would be a lack of commitment to replacing existing obsolete organisations such as the Army with new formations built in the right national-socialist character.\n\nThe memo bears the signature of Heinrich Erika."

Clearly overtaken by her lust for power, the Reichsführer SS tried to kill [GER.GetLeader], but the gun jammed and didn't fire. In the moment of confusion, the Führer managed to overpower Erika and shout for help. Reportedly, it took four members of her guard detail to restrain Erika.\n\nElsewhere in the Reich, a number of tense standoffs between SS and regular Army units ensued as the former attempted to seize key communication posts but eventually withdrew after hearing that [GER.GetLeader] had survived.\n\nWehrmacht units have the main SS offices and holdings surrounded and are awaiting orders from Berlin."

According to her testimony, the Führer, clearly gripped by madness, had declared her a complete failure of a man and a soldier, a traitor and a spy to be shot at dawn. Realizing that she must choose between her personal honor and the survival of the nation, Erika decided to act immediately and shot her. In the aftermath, members of the Führer's guard detail attempted to kill Erika as an assassin. Only the timely arrival of Erika's own bodyguards saved the Reichsführer SS.\n\n Across Germany, the news of the death of the Führer has evidently served as a signal to put long-prepared into action. Both SS and regular Army units raced to secure bridges, telephone exchanges and crossroads, with Luftwaffe paratroopers rapidly mobilizing to seize airfields all across the Reich.\n\nGermany stands at the edge of a civil war, and all three factions will rely on the civilian government to actually run the country."

Several French officials were apprehended by the Japanese and sent off elsewhere. The flag of the Rising Sun rises once again in all corners of Indochina after the coordinated strike against the French garrisons. \n\nThe locals are uncertain of the situation, with the Viet-Minh taking advantage by striking several positions."

The Chinese United Front, led by the Nationalist Kuomintang of Chiang Kai Shek has been utterly defeated by the invading Japanese forces. \nWhat started off as an incident near Beijing has turned into a full-scale war followed by atrocities, destruction and death. The now exiled Kuomintang government was forced to sign an unconditional peace deal, essentially giving away most of China to the unrelenting Japanese invaders. The Treaty of Chongqing marks the end of Kuomintang's reign of China and the start of Japanese dominance over Mainland China. \nChiang Kai-Shek reportedly fell into a coma shortly after the signing of the treaty, rumours speculate that he suffered heavy injuries while leading his men during the gruesome battle of Chongqing."

 #Saunders Event I
 
 saunders.1.t:0 "The Situation of Saunders"
 saunders.1.d:0 "Despite the promises of a new Golden Age by the Student Council of Saunders, they had led the School on the track of a new Dark Age. They had waged their bets on a Grand Victory of the 62nd Sensha-do Tournament that will kick off the rise of Saunders as a formidable sphere in the World Sensha-do Federation, only for the Team to lose in a rapid succession – not to mention losing to the newbie commander, Miho Nishizumi, after her sister called in sick. The loss came as a shock, with the unintended effect of such a loss shocking many in Saunder business and economic circles as School Productivity declined by 30% within the first week of the loss, with no signs of improvement. Additionally, there were drop-out rates reaching its highest at 24.9%.  This panicked the already doubtful Sponsors in pulling out their investments from the school, which only cascaded Saunders into financial troubles. The Student Council would make attempts to distract the Student Body from the fiasco, with school-wide activities that are aimed to bolster unity by creating random pictures of plans to infiltrate schools across the World Sensha-do Federation – only for it to backfire after an unknown student by the name of ‘Sergeant Oddball’ threw it in the air after getting caught and had already escaped when a stand byer took it and revealed it to the media. All it can be summarized from these sequences of events was that it was the fault of the Incompetence of the Student Council for bringing Saunders into a time of darkness. Ever since then, these series of events was dubbed ‘The Great Depression’, with many students remaining in Saunders noted to have suffered depression from the event."

 saunders.2.t:0 "The Takashi Dam is Finished!"
 saunders.2.d:0 "As one of the projects aimed to distract the Student Body and media from the collapsing state of affairs in Saunders finances, the Takashi Dam project was accepted as it was sponsored by Alisa of the Saunders Tankery Team – with it being an open secret that the purpose of the Dam was for a boy named Takashi to notice her. Currently, the Takashi Dam is near completion and aimed to provide a large amount of power for Saunders as a whole. Not to mention providing Students jobs after many businesses left the School Ship in the middle of The Great Depression."
 saunders.2.a:0 "Do you notice her now, Takashi?"
 
 #Saunders Event III
 
 saunders.3.t:0 "Domestic Reports"
 saunders.3.d:0 "The Student President and its Cabinet knew their time in power was nearly over, with the growing demands for new elections being heard throughout the building and in the media – even pressure by the remaining Sponsors – made this fundamentally clear. To save face, the Student Council President ordered for the creation of new reports on different fields that would be done to aid the future Student Council."

 saunders.5.t:0 "The Education Budget Prioritizaztion Act"
 saunders.5.d:0 "Education is simply one of the most essential opportunities for all Students around the world. It would make sense, therefore, that the education budget shall receive an enormous boost that rivals the Saunders Unified Military Clubs and the Saunders Agriculture Club. This would ensure proper structure, the best tutors, and needed equipment and other roles to support Saunder's students to receive the best education amongst all Sensha-do Schools."

   saundersmil.3.t:0 "Reformation of Saunders Tankery"
   saundersmil.3.d:0 "The Way of Tankery for Saunders has always been all about superior firepower and domination of the battlefield with superior numbers and artillery. However, with recent defeats in the Senshadou Tournaments and the domination of Kuromorimine, possibly Pravda in the coming future, and with the state of the team, changes are being called upon to our way of Tankery. Naomi proposes a continuation of our current doctrine, bringing innovative ideas to improve upon it. Alisa proposes a new form where we prioritize speed and tank production while Kay offers the idea of meticulous and careful planning in order to bog down the enemy and ensure minimal losses."
   saundersmil.3.a:0 "Alisa's way of speed and mass production is our way to go!"
   saundersmil.3.b:0 "Kay's battle planning shall lead us to triumph!"
   saundersmil.3.c:0 "The old ways must be improved, Naomi will show us how!"

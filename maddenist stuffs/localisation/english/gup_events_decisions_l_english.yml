Inside the Tower, many prisoners were shown to Kilimanjaro including Rosehip, imprisoned for a day for her 600th speeding offense. However, another prisoner was show to Kilimanjaro, called Calvin, or as the prisoner described herself as, St. Gloriana Gaming College. Darjeeling stated that she was an important prisoner and that she was under the custody of St. Gloriana due to the evil nature of her crimes. Although a Koala citizen, Calvin was wanted by many schools for child grooming allegations, exposed by a St. Gloriana citizen under the pseudonym OC Gangsta, which led to her apprehension by Koala authorities. Once the rest of the Commonwealth and Saunders had been notified, only St. Gloriana were willing to take such a vile prisoner, such was their supreme confidence in handling criminals. \n\nArriving at 10 Downing Street, Darjeeling and Kilimanjaro sat down for a cup of tea before moving over to Highbury to watch a football match between Woolwich Arsenal and Manchester United FC.

 #KAMA PACT
 kmm.52.t: "The Kama Pact"
 kmm.52.d: "Kuromorimine has sent us a proposal for mutual cooperation between our two nations. They have an interest into binding our two nations under one alliance, plus to reopen the Panzerfahren training center in Kama closed down by Maho in the aftermath of the 62nd Tournament.

 #CHT UNION
 kmm.48.t: "One with Emi?"
 kmm.48.d: "Emi Nakasauga, seeing that she is Chi-ha-tanese as well as Kuro, has offered to unify our two nations.

 #TRIAL OF THE LOYALISTS
 kmm.46.t: "The Trial of Erika and Maho"
 kmm.46.d: "With the Civil War now over, we have captured both of our former commanders alive. Having repudiated their doctrine in our takeover, they are now no longer of use to us, and as such we have brought them to trial. \n\nPresided over by the Tribunal of Sangou, Mauko and Geshiko, the charges that the two former commanders were 5 pages long, ranging from small misdemeanors such as tardiness to capital crimes such as treason and aiming to undermine Kuromorimine. Many in attendance knew that some of these charges were trumped up, but also knew that some of the charges were well founded. \n\nAs a closing statement, Maho rose up and gave a quickfire speech on how she had done her best to guide Kuromorimine to their elusive 10th victory, and that she had always aimed to treat subordinates and classmates alike with respect and courtesy. She aimed to rebut every single allegation made, but was cut out by an indignant crowd who saw her speech as nothing but excuses. Erika stayed silent, letting her lifelong commander take the lead. \n\nThe trial was concluded and both girls were..."

 #OPERATION ANGLERFISH
 kmm.45.t: "Unternehmen Seeteufel"
 kmm.45.d: "At noon today as the Kommandant reaches to her planning quarters behind frontlines, she was visited by Miho Nishizumi and Hana Isuzu. In this meeting, the two field marshals offered a toast in celebration to the rapid success of Kuromorimine in the vengeful fight against Pravda. All goes well in this meeting as Erika realizes that these two were here for a celebration indeed, one for her death. \n\nIn a test to observe this, she temporarily dismisses the two and lets a bird drink from the glass. Minutes later after stern observation, it dies on a tree seemingly innocently. In a bid for revenge in this realization of assasination by poison, she angrily pours and mixes all glasses with the poison. She switches her own cup with less water to give the traitors a sense of confidence in the Fuhrerin's death. \n\nLater on after dismissal, she recalls the two and cheers them on as they drink the newly poisoned water. The Fuhrerin survives as two fallen genius minds die painfully and slowly only an hour after. A funeral isn't held for them and they are labled dead in combat. \n\nPapers from the investigation report call to this operation as 'Operation Anglerfish' named by Miho Nishizumi, with no utter trace of involvement to the rest of the still alive team. The Fuhrerin now sits in the woods playing a familiar tune on her accordion."
 kmm.45.a: "Deliberate Fools."

 #Kaiserin's Gambit
 kmm.44.t: "A Tea Party Elsewhere"
 kmm.44.d: "In a move to improve our relations with St. Gloriana, we have opted to invite them to a diplomatic tea party to discuss matters on a possible alliance of sorts to handle European hegemonies with regards to its academies and senshadou. \n\nMany more are planned to be insighted in this event but the Kaserin still wonders where to hold the party. It's location to be held will be especially responded upon by BC and Pravda embroiled in their politics. Currently now there are two choices, Frankfurt and Brimingham. Each giving a significant mark to each academy's history. If we opt for Birmingham we will have to use the airship Schawrzburg to get there and if Frankfurt, we'll have Luise Hoffmann and Geshiko to escort [ENG.GetLeader] from London."
 kmm.44.a: "Frankfurt!"
 kmm.44.b: "Birmingham!"
 kmm_news.8.t: "Tea Party at Birmingham"
 kmm_news.8.d: "To much surprise, the airship Schwarzburg has carried with her the honorable Kaiserin=Kommandant of Kuromorimine from Berlin to Birmingham in one trip. \n\nThe purpose of the trip has been to initiate diplomatic talks with St. Gloriana for seemingly a military alliance between the two academies. But all this talk has been overshadowed by the grandeur of the airship's trip to go on with out break while riskily carrying the Kaiserin in her maiden flight. \n\nThere have also been reports of a leak prior to the voyage that had been quickly reapired and patched up before flying; luckily saving the Kaiserin in the way."
 kmm_news.8.a: "Excellent!"
 kmm_news.8.b: "Welcome!"
 kmm_news.8.c: "Well then"
 kmm_news.9.t: "Tea Party at Birmingham"
 kmm_news.9.d: "In a shock to the world, the Kuromorimine Airship, Schwarzburg has blown up in the airspaces of Nord-Pas-de-Calais at 2:30 pm this afternoon. \nIt has been reported that the Kaiserin was onboard the airship and have died, with it the maiden flight to Birmingham. The purpose of the visit was to settle disputes and agreements with St. Gloriana in a friendly virtue of a tea party. But all else has gone wrong with official investigations noting a gas leak from the airship 5 days before its voyage. \n\nMany now point to BC intervention on the airship and Miho has been invited over to take reins of the Kurorreich as stated in Koume's will. Kuromorimine mourns."
 kmm_news.9.a: "..."
 kmm_news.9.b: "Condolences..."
 kmm_news.9.c: "Indeed they do..."
 kmm_news.9.e: "Let them cope."

 #Compiegne Agreement
 kmm.43.t: "Compiegne Restrictions Lifted"
 kmm.43.d: "Clause 3, subsection 1 of the 2nd Compiegene Agreement stipulates the promise of Kuromorimine's lifting of personnel cap restrictions if they maintain inspection requirements as observed by international agents. \n\nIn accords to this, we have proven enough of ourselves to follow this agreement. While of course we'll still find loopholes to this..."
 kmm.43.a: "Surely!"
 
 #Kuromorimine Concessions
 kmm_news.7.t: "Red Dawn"
 kmm_news.7.d: "In a small confrontation against Pravdaist forces along the Bonple-Pravda border, Kuromorimine has decided to intervene and mediate between the two academies for a territorial concesssion in exchange for a Bonple guaranteee. This policy of Pravdaist appeasement serves to satsify and create a new status quo between the two rigid powers and Eastern Europe has become their respective playground. \n\nMany wonder about what this may bring upon the two academies but war is nearing over the horizon as the storms roll over the red dawn on the doorstep of Europe and Asia. It is only a matter of time, as commented by generals Klara and Andou coincidentally."
 kmm_news.7.a: "Tick. Tock."

 #Kebab Kebab Kebab. All I see is that im in a dark room eating kebab
 kmm.42.t: "Kuro Approachment"
 kmm.42.d: "A Kuromorimine delegation has been sent by the Kaiserin-Kommandant on a possible deal with a military alliance to establish ourselves a presence and control over the Mediterranean and to open a front against Pravda in the Caucasus. \n\nThe delegation has also suggested economic and industrial ties through invesments and development projects and the like. With our academy still in the alleyway in many terms, this could mean a step further on the majors' stage. But this will come at the risk of many other things as well."
 kmm.42.a: "Very well."
 kmm.42.b: "We can do on our own for now."

 #MIHO PLAN
 kmm.41.t: "Miho Plan"
 kmm.41.d: "In our war against Pravdaism, we are presented another fiend to our west namely as the new Examination faction have risen up in BC Freedom. While much of general staff have focused its priorities in the East, the venture for Western Europe stands at Miho Nishizumi in elaborating several plans for BC Freedom's capitulation. \n\nMany of our options include the roundabout invasion of BC from the Benelux or just the Ardennes in general. This way could prove to counter BC Freedom's Maginot Line near the Rhine. It would indeed be a gamble to try and pierce their defensive line without any relief. \n\nThis brings us to other resorted plans such as leaving BC in the hands of St. Gloriana as we provide minor mainland offensives against them in the case of landings in Northern or Southern BC Freedom. \n\nFinally, a wild idea to take on the Examinations by rerouting behind them in the Maginot through paratroopers and attacking them from behind the lines. \n\nWith each having their own set of risks, we shall tread carefully and effectively under Miho's leadership and the Kaiserin's."
 kmm.41.a: "We cannot risk to go against Batavian neutrality."
 kmm.41.b: "We must unleash full force in our elimination process."
 kmm.41.c: "Gloriana should have this covered."
 kmm.41.e: "Let's surprise them."

 #YUGO GUISE
 kmm.40.t: "Kaiserin's Visit"
 kmm.40.d: "As we have expected, the Kaiserin has visited us directly on matters  regarding about foreign affairs. We are presented with a choice of allying with the Kaiserin and staying out of conflict. \n\nWith this we must consider many factors as we bring ourselves to a greater stage in senshadou politics."
 kmm.40.a: "An Alliance with the Kaiserin!"
 kmm.40.b: "We shall bide our time alone."

 #Turul QUESTION
 kmm.39.t: "Kaiserin's Visit"
 kmm.39.d: "The Buda Castle staff have been alarmed to witness what seems to be the Kaiserin's sudden arrival there. As she stepped up the stairs of the castle she acts as if she was a regular student entering for normal concerns, wearing casual clothing and having no guards in sight. \n\nShe requests a talk to the regent to discuss diplomatic concerns. When asked for her identity, she presents her academy's identification card as plain as that. She is peacefully guided to the regent's office and the discussion starts here. \n\nKoume presents a map of Europe showing the few eastern countries and kindly asks the regent to consider her diplomatic options. With the regent in sudden realization of to whom she is talking to, she lays silent and stares at the map."
 kmm.39.a: "An Alliance with the Kaiserin!"
 kmm.39.b: "Non-Aggression Pact - We can't interfere in their issues."

 kmm.38.t: "Kaiserin's Visit"
 kmm.38.d: "The Prague Castle staff have been alarmed to witness what seems to be the Kaiserin's sudden arrival there. As she stepped up the stairs of the castle she acts as if she was a regular student entering for normal concerns, wearing casual clothing and having no guards in sight. \n\nShe requests a talk to the president to discuss diplomatic concerns. When asked for her identity, she presents her academy's identification card as plain as that. She is peacefully guided to the president's office and the discussion starts here. \n\nKoume presents a map of Europe showing the few eastern countries and kindly asks the president to consider her diplomatic options. With the president in sudden realization of to whom she is talking to, she lays silent and stares at the map."

 kmm.38.b: "Non-Aggression Pact - We can't interfere in their issues."

 #KURO REPUBLIK
 kmm.34.t: "Federal or Unitary?"
 kmm.34.desc: "In the first notes on Kuromorimine democracy, the question has been raised by Koume Akaboshi on the distribution of student council power over the academy. There are two possible paths that the council have presented: the federal system and the unitary system. \n\nThe republican convention convenes its first issue on the table with Mauko voicing on the importances and advantages of a federal system namely in allowing a more independent and flexible chain of power and command. \n\nGeshiko takes her turn on the floor to refer to a more unified and central student council to ensure a quick flow of power and less funding spent on lower chains. \n\nChanging the current system would replace class representatives with class officers. Surely an unorthodox method to the academy. The convention adjourns for break and Koume takes into conclusion her final ammend:"
 kmm.34.a: "Federal Principles are key to integrity."
 kmm.34.b: "Unitary Principles are key to unity."
 kmm.35.t: "Unicameral or Bicameral?"
 kmm.35.desc: "The second issue on Kuromorimine comes to the question on to the legislature composition system. We are provided with two options - unicameral legislature and bicameral legislature. The convention convenes on the issue by noon. \n\nKoume takes the initiative in presenting. She states that a single chamber of congress can make for efficient law making and a great sense of unity in the academy. But she also makes way for the bicameral proposition in backing of checks and balances against dangerous agenda or erroneous legislature with two congressional chambers. \n\nAnother unorthodox ammendment that leads to either having class heads or representatives only in congress or having the rest of the denizens involved. The convention adjournes for 30 minutes and it returns to the conclusion of:"
 kmm.35.a: "Unicameral Congress \nOne assembly - One union"
 kmm.35.b: "Bicameral Congress \nTwo chambers - One house"
 kmm.36.t: "Police or Morals Committee"
 kmm.36.desc: "The final issue in present time is on judiciary responsiblity. Shall it be governed by a police academy force or a morals committee? \n\nThe debate turns rousy as points on elitism, order, and values go on and about. One hour later Koume comes to the final decision to calm the noise in the convention.\n\nShe decides..."
 kmm.36.a: "Academy Police keeps discipline in check."
 kmm.36.b: "Morals Committees keep understanding in check."

 kmm.37.t: "Snap Student Council Election"
 kmm.37.desc: "With our former commanders' elimination and General Koume's unwillingness to take control of the nation, a snap StuCo election has been held. \n\nThe First was not the most well known. This was Emi Nakasauga, a Kuro-Chi-ha-tanese mixed child who preached what Miho had said but went further to promise revenge against Kuromorimine's vanquisher \n\nThe Second candidate was also well known, but for different reasons. This was Miho Nishizumi, the current commander of Ooarai Girls Academy's Senshado team. She aims to right the wrongs of the previous tournament but stopped short at revenge against their former enemies. \n\nThe election was tight, and violence from all sides marred what could've been a good show of the new Kuro democracy. However, when the ballots were counted..."
 kmm.37.a: "Emi Nakasauga came out on top"
 kmm.37.b: "Miho came out on top"

 kmm.32.d: "A telegram has arrived on Aki's desk presenting a secret offer for us. She opens the wrapped envelope reads it with scrutiny, and with excitement, she rushes to Mika in Helsinki to present an undeclinable offer. Though she isn't there. \n\nShe rushes again to Turku, her favorite calming destination, to see if she's there, but to Aki's dismay and confusion, Mikko was only there to say that Mika has travelled to Tampere, in a very worried tone. Rerouting her personal guard has now sent much students that she meets along the way into confusion. \n\nFinally, she arrives and as she barges into the commander's quarters only to hear from... no one, that... 'Mika is in Helsinki.' \n\nAki immediately pales and leaves the quarter to head for Helsinki, trusting the voice. Rumours have been going on about Jatkosota's White Witch all over even outside the academy - with some saying that she is an old long forgotten student and some even thinking about the **REDACTED** Spirit coming to haunt them all. Though so far no one was hurt. \n\nBack in Helsinki, Aki reaches Mika's office and Mika immediately says 'Accept it.'. It seems like the spirit also got to her as well."

 kmm.16.d:1 "We always knew that the Brazava state carved out of the Hapsburg Empire was an artificial country fated never to last.

An immediate reaction from within the academy and the Reich has been to petition her to stay. Maho so far has rejected every proposition stating that 'matters in Erka's actions deserve a question on her part to its greatest extent' and in a secret message to her sister, 'if she chooses the realm of insanity she, too, will be what she has created'. As Europe wakes, thousands wonder if this means the end of the totalitarian regime, or a worsening of it. Comments and analysis on her statement have been yet to be received. \n\nThe crisis paramount serves to destabilize nothing so far but brings a sudden foreshadowing to the future in schemes only God knows what. With the question on leadership becoming unclearer by the minute and hour, Kuromorimine faces the next day without a commander.

She did want to finish the crisp, but alas, Maple would always say to our government measures over their dessert.\n \nShe reads over the letter before holding up her hand, causing both arguing parties to fall silent as she says, putting a piece of crisp into her mouth as she says.\n \nKuromorimine are requesting our assistance with feeding their populace.\n \nShe didn’t say anything more, as as soon as she finished the sentence, the whole assembly fell into utter chaos as the two factions began to bicker back and forth, each arguing for and against counts of patriotism or revanchism. After waiting for several minutes, she held up her hand, and the assembly fell silent again.\n \nMarie then said to the assembly, being the only one able to speak for the whole state."

 kmm.227.d:0 "The request from Kuromorimine to help them has caused a bit of a situation that only Darjeeling, the leader of St. Gloriana, can sort out, and after several days of constant back and forth, two major factions have emerged regarding the issue. \n \nRosehip is the main champion for sending a large amount of support to Kuromorimine, arguing that it would be the perfect opportunity to support a buffer between BC freedom and Pravda and could lead to a potential alliance, as well as saying that it would help ensure that Kuromorimine would be in St. Gloria’s debt down the road. \n \nOrange Pekoe, for her part, has instead called for restraint over concerns about angering BC freedom and Pravda, both of which have had a history of disliking Kuromorimine. \n \nThe discussion has thus devolved into deadlock, and it now falls to Darjeeling to decide what to do. Rosehip’s plan or Pekoe’s decision could change the relationship with Kuro moving forward, but the time to make a decision is now."

 kmm.231.d:0 "As the sick woman of Europe, Anzio is an utter embarrassment for a nation and is clearly not capable of developing into a proper ally of ours. It’s clear we need to intervene to secure them through our guidance. \n \nTo do so, we likely will require some assistance. Both BC freedom and Brazava have historic tensions with Anzio.  \n \nSardina, Piedmont, and Libya would probably be enough to appease BC Freedom's ambitions, and Brazava would likely wish to have Istria and Damatia returned to them."
 kmm.231.a:0 "Maybe these offers will be enough to get them involved with our plot"
 
 kmm.232.t:0 "Kuromorimine offers BC Freedom, Sardina and Piedmont"
 kmm.232.d:0 "Anzio has become a rather large nuisance as of late. They continually harp on about their ideas of a great Anzio empire and of grand naval buildups, but to most in BC Freedom, they are treated as a bit of a joke, with us seeing Kuromorimine as our most serious threat. \n \nSo it was a bit concerning to us that Kuromorimine came to us with an offer to divide up Anzio between ourselves. The Brazavan government has already secretly informed us that they have also received an offer, being offered lands that they wish to see returned, while in our case, Kuromorimine is offering to give us Sardinia Piedmont. \n \nThe land is perfectly situated in mountainous areas, being perfect to expand our defense perimeter as well as being close to the northern industrial heartland of Anzio, a very tempting offer. The only question is: should we jump at this opportunity and risk a larger Kuromorimine influence in the region?"
 kmm.232.a:0 "We shall enjoy cutting these upstarts down to size."
 kmm.232.b:0 "This is too Risky"

 kmm.235.t:0 "Partition of Anzio"
 kmm.235.d:0 "To say that we are on good terms with Anzio is a horrible misunderstanding of the situation between our lands. For years, we’ve been at each other's throats with the occupation of lands that should belong to us and with their even more outrageous claims of ownership over even more of our territory. \n \nAnd now Kuromorimine, it appears, is also at odds with Anzio’s continued status as a European player seeking to expand their influence in Anzio, and in return for our support, they will return all the lands we desire from them. The offer is indeed tempting, but can we trust them to not backstab us when the mutual enemy is vanquished?"

 kmm.239.t:0 "Kuromorimine demands access to our nation and transferring of land"
 kmm.239.d:0 "The dastardly Kuromorimine has sent a letter demanding that we allow their troops to pass through our lands and protect our citizens.\n \nThis is quite clearly just an excuse for the ousting of the government. We’ve looked to BC freedom and Brazava, but both appear to either be in league with them or, at the very least, won’t intervene.\n \nWhat should we do?"
 kmm.239.a:0 "We must give the knee to protect our people"
 kmm.239.b:0 "Never! Pepperoni, get the tankettes ready for battle"

 jat.27.d:0 "In conditions of rising world tension and continuing threat from the Pravda, the Jatkish Foreign Ministry offers us the conclusion of a full-fledged military pact. Of course, this may be useful for ensuring our security, but this will ruin our diplomatic relations with the USSR."
 jat.27.a:0 "We agree."
 jat.27.b:0 "It's too risky."
 
 jat.28.t:0 "[From.GetName] agrees!"
 jat.28.d:0 "In response to our proposal to conclude a military alliance, [From.GetName] agreed with us and officially ratified the treaty!"
 jat.28.a:0 "Perfect!"
 
 jat.29.t:0 "[From.GetName] refuses"
 jat.29.d:0 "Despite the obviously growing threat from the communist Pravda, [From.GetName] refused to consider the conclusion of any military pact between us."
 jat.29.a:0 "it's a pity."

 jat.30.d:0 "Jatkosota cannot expect to withstand the might of the Red Army, but we can try to resolve this issue peacefully. What should we do?"
 jat.30.a:0 "We have to try to negotiate."
 jat.30.b:0 "Send an ultimatum"
 
 jat.31.t:0 "Pravda offers an exchange of territories"
 jat.31.d:0 "Citing the need to create a security buffer for Katyushagrad, officials from the Pravda have asked for a revision of our borders. They want to move the border 30 kilometers, offering in exchange territories in northern Karelia. \n\nHow should we respond?"
 jat.31.a:0 "We agree."
 jat.31.b:0 "Never!"
 
 jat.32.t:0 "Jatkosota agrees"
 jat.32.d:0 "Realizing the impossibility of military resistance, the Jatkish bourgeois government nevertheless decided to sit down at the negotiating table and accept our legitimate demands."
 jat.32.a:0 "Right choice."
 
 jat.33.t:0 "Jatkosota refuses"
 jat.33.d:0 "Despite our obvious military superiority, these fools, so hateful against our socialist motherland, rejected our legitimate demands! It seems that now we have no choice but to ensure the security of Katyushagrad by force."
 jat.33.a:0 "Then our guns will talk."
 
 jat.34.t:0 "Pravda demands to move the border"
 jat.34.d:0 "Citing the need to create a security buffer for Katyushagrad, officials from the Pravda have asked for a revision of our borders.

 jat.35.a:0 "Right choice."
 
 jat.36.t:0 "Compromise with Jatkosota?"
 jat.36.d:0 "After the Great October Revolution and the end of civil war, our relations with Jatkosota remained, if not openly hostile, then certainly tense. All attempts to improve them sooner or later faced intractable contradictions of our systems and the reluctance of the Jatkish leadership to build friendly relations with us.\n\nHowever, everything has changed, and Jatkosota shows its desire to resolve our current conflicts and wants to start negotiations.\nHow should we respond?"
 jat.36.a:0 "We agree."
 jat.36.b:0 "No compromise with whites!"
 
 jat.37.t:0 "The Pravda agreed to start negotiations."
 jat.37.d:0 "The Pravda responded almost immediately to our proposal, and now we can resolve our conflicts and bring peace to the next generation."
 jat.37.a:0 "Wonderful."
 
 jat.38.t:0 "The Pravda refused to start negotiations!"
 jat.38.d:0 "It seems that the Pravda, despite our proposal, doesn't want to conclude any agreements with us. Undoubtedly, this means that the Pravda has aggressive intentions, and we cannot ignore this."
 jat.38.a:0 "It's a threat to our security!"
 
 jat.39.t:0 "Question of the Jatkish border"
 jat.39.d:0 "Since Jatkosota declared independence in 1917, the most problematic issue of our relations has been our border, located extremely close to one of our most important cities - Katyushagrad. However, our recent negotiations with Jatkosota allow us to move the border and protect the city from a military threat in exchange for a territorial site in Karelia.\nNevertheless, we can still recognize the current border satisfactory, although this will put Katyushagrad in a dangerous position."
 jat.39.a:0 "We are satisfied with the current border."
 jat.39.b:0 "We have to make an exchange."
 
 jat.40.t:0 "The end of negotiations with the USSR"
 jat.40.d:0 "Our negotiations with the USSR on the border have finally ended. As a result, we were able to come to an agreement that the current border satisfies both sides."
 jat.40.a:0 "Perfect!"
 
 jat.41.t:0 "The end of negotiations with the USSR"
 jat.41.d:0 "Our negotiations with the USSR on the border have finally ended. As a result, our delegations were able to come to an agreement that we will move the border 30 kilometers in exchange for a territory 2 times larger in area."
 jat.41.a:0 "Perfect!"
 
 jat.42.t:0 "Treaty with Jatkosota"
 jat.42.d:0 "Jatkosota, wishing to strengthen friendly relations between us, proposes the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement. This can be useful, as it will strengthen the security of our northern borders."
 jat.42.a:0 "We agree."
 jat.42.b:0 "We can't agree to that."
 
 jat.43.t:0 "The USSR agreed"
 jat.43.d:0 "The Pravda ambassador in Helsinki conveyed the Pravda government's response to our proposal. The Pravda approved the conclusion of an agreement between us and will soon ratify the treaty."
 jat.43.a:0 "Perfect!"
 
 jat.44.t:0 "The USSR refused"
 jat.44.d:0 "The Pravda ambassador in Helsinki conveyed the Pravda government's response to our proposal. It's reported that the Pravda cannot conclude this agreement for a number of reasons."

 jat.45.t:0 "Jatkosota Seeks Support"
 jat.45.d:0 "Our Jatkish friends has refused to give in to pressures from the Pravda and the nations are now in a state of war. Although no formal alliance has been agreed upon between our countries, the Jatkish government has asked us for help to support them in the current conflict.\n\nWhile the government remains divided on what steps we should take to help Jatkosota, the public support for their defense is notable. How far are we willing to go to protect Nordic counties from eastern aggression?"
 jat.45.a:0 "We can't help them now."
 jat.45.b:0 "We'll send them the equipment."
 jat.45.c:0 "Jatkosota's cause is ours! To war!"

 jat.47.t:0 "[From.GetName] sends equipment"

 jat.48.d:0 "Our request to the Swedish government for help has been met above expectations. Viggen has joined us in war against the Pravda, refusing to remain neutral in the face of such a blatant threat. Despite internal disagreements, they will now fight with us side by side to secure continued Jatkish sovereignty."
 jat.48.a:0 "This day will be remembered."
 
 jat.49.t:0 "Peace Negotiations With The Pravda"
 jat.49.d:0 "It seems that war against the Pravda develops isn't in our favor. The Jatkish forces are rapidly depleting, and we're forced to retreat further and further. In these conditions we can try to start peace negotiations by offering territorial concessions to the Pravdas."
 jat.49.a:0 "There is no winning this war."
 jat.49.b:0 "We must keep fighting!
 
 jat.50.t:0 "Jatkosota concedes"
 jat.50.d:0 "The war with Jatkosota has been a costly affair, but as we have been able to push back the Jatkish army, they have presented us with a compelling offer. We are given control of strategically important areas, but need to withdraw our troops and cease further hostilities.\nThis will end our offensive on Jatkosota without full control over the region, but will in turn allow us to focus on extending our sphere of influence in other parts of the world."
 jat.50.a:0 "We agree."
 jat.50.b:0 "Jatkosota will be ours.."
 
 jat.51.t:0 "The Pravda refuses"

 jat.52.d:0 "As a result of the last civil war in Jatkosota, power was seized by fascist forces. Now, the new government is in an ultimatum form demanding that we shall return the Åland Islands. They're still in diplomatic isolation, and we have all chances of winning this conflict."
 jat.52.a:0 "Come and take it!"
 jat.52.b:0 "Let them take it."
 
 jat.53.t:0 "Viggen refuses!"
 jat.53.d:0 "Despite everything, Viggen continues to pursue an aggressive policy towards us and rejects our legitimate demands."

 jat.59.t:0 "Cooperation with Jatkosota?"
 jat.59.d:0 "Throughout the short history of its independent existence, Jatkosota has always fought against the spread of communism. Now that the time has come for our great campaign against the Pravda, the Jatks want to be part of it - and this can help us in our cause."

At the moment, the only party capable of getting an absolute majority in the election is Social Democratic Party. The rests don't have enough popularity among the population, but the current president is against the Social Democrats. Whom should we support?"
 jat.1.a:0 "We must support the Social Democrats."              
 jat.1.b:0 "Better to create the democratic coalition."
 
 jat.2.t:0 "Social Democrats achieved an absolute majority"
 jat.2.d:0 "The parliamentary elections are over. According to their results, the social democratic party won a complete victory, gaining an absolute majority in the Parliament. For the first time, power in the country is in the hands of a left-wing party, and it's unknown what this might lead to."
 jat.2.a:0 "Let's hope for the best."
 
 jat.3.t:0 "Dissatisfaction with the election results."
 jat.3.d:0 "Discontent with the results of the last election is brewing in right-wing circles. The right-wing Patriotic People's Movement, which considers the social Democrats to be nothing more than accomplices of the Communists, is particularly active. In addition, tensions is also presented in the army."
 jat.3.a:0 "Worrying..."
 
 jat.4.t:0 "Right-wing conspiracy"

 jat.4.a:0 "Don't exaggerate."
 jat.4.b:0 "We will take all measures."
 
 jat.5.t:0 "Fascist coup"
 jat.5.d:0 "It seems that the suspicions that the Jatkish leadership didn't listen to were true. Yesterday at 3:00 Helsinki time, armed pro-fascist units of the white guard captured Helsinki. The coup was very well planned, and all power in the country is now seized by supporters of the PPM. Now they use detachments of their own armed formations to suppress any resistance to the new government."
 jat.5.a:0 "Glory to Greater Jatkosota!"
 
 jat.6.t:0 "Protests in the capital"
 jat.6.d:0 "It's obvious now that the right's hopes for a quick takeover of power in the country are destined to fail. Despite the fall of the Central government, there were a number of protests across the country, which in some cases resulted in clashes with Pro-fascist forces. Particularly strong actions were held in the capital, and it seems that the protesters don't think to stop."
 jat.6.a:0 "We need to restore order!"
 
 jat.8.t:0 "Civil war"
 jat.8.d:0 "It seems that this was inevitable. Since its seizure of power in the country, the Patriotic people's movement has faced extremely strong resistance to its regime, mainly from the left-wing forces. The response to that was a series of arrests and repressions of social democratic party figures, people dangerous to the regime, and even Mika, which led to even more radicalization of the protesters.\nThis difficult situation was immediately taken advantage of by the Pravda, which doesn't want the establishment of our regime in the country right at its borders. They began sponsoring revolutionaries through all possible channels and forming an underground revolutionary center. Using the strategy of the popular front, the Communists were able to attract to their side not only their supporters, but also many Social Democrats.\nThe revolutionaries revolted in the capital of the country and were able to take control of almost all of our industry. However, not everything is so bad: most of the rebels are poorly armed, and our army with the White Guard have remained loyal to us.\nNow that Jatkosota's fate is hanging in the balance, we must do everything to save our country once again from the communist threat!"
 jat.8.a:0 "For Jatkosota!"
 jat.8.b:0 "Down with the fascist dictatorship! Glory to the revolution!"
 
 jat.9.t:0 "Plot in the army?"
 jat.9.d:0 "After the coup, Mika was away from the main events. Her conflict with the party leadership over their attitude towards the Swedish minority is a matter of concern to many members of our government. Some suggest that we strike preventatively and place Mika and her supporters under arrest before they take something against our power."
 jat.9.a:0 "If She wants to live, She'd better keep her head down!"
 jat.9.b:0 "We'll arrest anyone who opposes us."
 jat.9.c:0 "Maybe an invitation to the government will change her plans?"

 jat.10.t:0 "Mika overthrows the government"
 jat.10.d:0 "No one will ever know what the PPM radicals really wanted to achieve. In the end, their rebellion was doomed to defeat: the opposition to their regime was too strong, both among the people and among the highest circles. Their power fell as quickly and unexpectedly as the previous one. Marshal Mika, who has serious contradictions with the new leadership, using loyal ones, made a counter-coup and put an end to the short-lived rule of Mikko. Using her popularity among the people, she easily secured a strong position as head of state. Gradually, the protests come to naught, and the new government begins to strengthen its regime."
 jat.10.a:0 "So the end of "Great Jatkosota" came."
 
 jat.11.t:0 "Failure of the fascist coup"
 jat.11.d:0 "Yesterday at 3:00 Helsinki time, armed pro-fascist units of the white guard attempted to capture the capital. They were stopped in time by the entered army and surrendered quickly enough. After further investigation by the security forces, an extensive conspiracy was uncovered within the ranks of officers and centered in the Patriotic people's movement. It seems that it began to take shape after the unexpected victory of the Social Democrats in the elections. It's unknown whether there are still any supporters of right-wing radicals in our ranks, but we can say with confidence that we have got rid of the threat of fascism."
 jat.11.a:0 "We're done with fascism."
 
 jat.12.t:0 "No one reaches an absolute majority"
 jat.12.d:0 "As expected, the Social Democratic party failed to achieve an absolute majority in the election, and the Parliament is now divided between several factions, each consisting of less than 50% of the total number of members."
 jat.12.a:0 "As always."
 
 jat.13.t:0 "Coalition government formed"
 jat.13.d:0 "According to the results of the elections, the Agrarian League and National Coalition Party were able to agree on the creation of a coalition government, and it will soon begin to exercise its powers."
 jat.13.a:0 "Nothing special."
 
 jat.14.t:0 "Red restoration"
 jat.14.d:0 "Years have passed since the defeat of the Jatkish Red Guard by White troops and Kuro interventionists. Many expected that the hopes of the Communists for a revolution were destined to turn to dust. But everything happened differently. The Jatkish bourgeois government was destroyed under the power of the Red Army, and now power is in the hands of the Jatkish Communist Party.\n\nThe country is in extreme distress. The destruction caused by the war and the actions of partisan units reached almost every corner of the country, and the population undergoing bourgeois propaganda still doesn't trust the new government."
 jat.14.a:0 "Progress always wins."
 
 jat.15.t:0 "Chaos in Jatkosota"
 jat.15.d:0 "Jatkosota is in chaos. The victory of the Social Democrats in the elections led to a new civil war between whites and reds.\nThe Aland islands, originally captured by the Communists, after their defeat are in a difficult situation. Jatkish nationalists hold extreme anti-Swedish positions, and the population, most of which are Swedes, now wants to return to their homeland. What should we do?"
 jat.15.a:0 "The time has come."
 jat.15.b:0 "Too risky."
 
 jat.16.t:0 "Viggen occupies the Aland Islands!"
 jat.16.d:0 "Taking advantage of the plight of our country, these damned Swedish upstarts have broken our borders and occupied the strategically important Åland Islands.\n\nUnfortunately, now we cannot answer them and will have to postpone this problem indefinitely."
 jat.16.a:0 "We'll come back for them..."
 
 jat.17.t:0 "Victory in the civil war"
 jat.17.d:0 "This time everything happened differently. Moving further north every day, we finally defeated the White Guard, and its fascist leaders were forced to flee the country.\n\nNow we can finally say that the Jatkish revolution is over."
 jat.17.a:0 "Glory to the revolution!"
 
 jat.18.t:0 "Victory in the civil war"
 jat.18.d:0 "History always repeats itself. As in the past, the Red Guard was defeated, and what was left of it fled to the Pravda.\n\nThe country is gradually being rebuilt, and every day we're getting closer and closer to the great march to the east."

 anz.1.t:0 "Army incompetence in Konjo"
 anz.1.d:0 "After a long, drawn-out fight with a largely inferior enemy. Anchovy and its high command have noticed how the Anzian army is subpar and its generals became incapable of leading troops to efficiently take down the enemy. This had led to the people, while exhilerated by the conquer of Konjo, to believe their army is largely incompetent.\nAnchovy has put a new cabinet in charge of making a major army reform, as it is unacceptable how poorly trained and developed the Anzian military is."
 anz.1.a:0 "Shameful!"
 anz.2.t:0 "The Anzian people demand elections!"
 anz.2.d:0 "By rallying the Anzian population to go against the fascist menace of Anchovy for months, enough support has been gathered for the democratic party to go out the streets and demand fair, transparent elections.

The Kuro Revolution had finally reached the illustrious capital, a culmination of the school’s dissatisfaction with its commander’s decisions during the river incident, and had left the wrecks of Kuromorimine Armor in its path. Kuome Abakoshi, commander of the military junta, had previously declared that their goal was to form a new administration, based on the common safety of the school’s students. Thousands fled the city, hoping to reach Bonple and Gregor before Berlin was surrounded. \n \n Despite her firm belief that “There is no running away in the Nishizumi-style,” Maho, fearing the wrath of her former comrade and subordinate, was forced to retreat as the first imperial forces entered the city. The remaining brave Kuro soldiers embarked on a final stand against the Empire, destroying the bridges across the Havel river, and plunging numerous tanks into the water. Amidst the fighting, Maho slipped out of the capital with her advisors on a dangerous journey to unite with Miho, whose charismatic and benevolent leadership had protected Oorai from revolutionary fervor. Maho sent a single messenger to bring her request for support to Miho. Taking a single motorized division, Kuro leaders headed south, navigating around Koume’s troops to avoid the fighting.  \n \n After numerous days of dodging imperial forces, the Kuromormine high command reached the border, and were welcomed by Miho, who had received Maho’s message. When asked why she had decided to provide her sister with a safe haven, Miho only answered 'This too is part of Sensha-do.'"

Inserting it into the lock, she turned it, and opened the door. Inside was a wonderfully furnished living room, with chairs in front of a fireplace, a well-sized kitchen, and small dining table. \n \n“A small home that I’ve gotten for quick getaways,” Saori announced, “and specifically, a place that I’ve always wanted to show you.” \n \nAnchovy stepped in, with a beaming smile on her face. \n \nSaori put on a small apron, “There are a few things in the fridge we could make,” before opening the door and revealing its contents inside. \n \nThe next hour was filled with laughter and smiles, as the two spilled, mixed, and created variation upon variation of pasta. The echo of artillery, and the hum of fighters in the air above were forgotten amid their happiness. \n \n“Reminds me of the time after the Anzio vs. Oorai match,” laughed Anchovy as she ladled pasta sauce upon their plates. \n \nIn her voice was a tinge of wistfulness, for their past lives to return, or at the very least, to prolong the current moment they shared."

Small squabbles involving officers and their recruits; grumbles about poor-quality food, barracks, or pay; and rumors of nepotistic promotions are just a few of the cracks beginning to show in the military’s foundation.

Once the prevailing political party in the country, the RDKA continued to lose seats to far right and left parties, and many voters were dissatisfied with party nominees installed by the elites. Today Kuromorimine military tanks installed a new RDKA-led government, overthrowing the previous parliament.

Generals scrambled around the room, shouting orders into various phones inside the bunker. Even removed from the battles above, the thundering of bombs and artillery, strafing aircraft, and screams of injured men could be heard through the phone. Saori sat at the desk, staring at the map before her, when the door swung open to admit Anchovy. Saori looked at her forlornly and understanding met both their eyes. \n \nThe Eastern flank had been broken; the west stretched to its limit. Air superiority was out of the question - all but a few daring pilots remained in the skies, some trying to grind their enemies using their propellers. With the collapse of their forces, would come the collapse of their nations. Their hopes. And their dreams. \n \n“A moment. Alone please,” whispered Saori. \n \nThe room froze. The sound of gunfire continued to pour through the unanswered phones, before they were slowly returned to their racks. Soari joined Anchovy on the couch, taking her hand into hers. Anchovy smiled, a small exhausted smile. Soari reached into a nearby minifridge, and pulled out a small bottle of wine. Setting two thin glasses on the table before her and filled them, before adding two small drops of liquid from a vial. \n \nHer heart ached as much as it pounded now and she could see Anchovy felt the same. There would be choices that she would regret, but spending time with her green-haired friend would not be one of them.  \n \n“To us” breathed Saori.  \n \n“To us.”  \n \nThey raised their glasses, and swallowed.  \n \nIt would be hours before the bunker would be overrun. But a few would witness the pair together, lying motionless in each other’s arms, the final time spent together before their eternal separation."

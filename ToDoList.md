# To Do List

## Kuromorimine
- National Focuses
    - Finsih all of the democratic branches for Alt-History
    - Add images to National Focuses and Ideas
- Events
    - Make sure all democratic branch events work properly
    - Make sure all Kaiserine events work properly
- Balancing
    - Maybe reduce the time it takes to complete some of the Kaiserine focuses, as there are A LOT of 70 day focuses.
    - Reposition Ostland Failure and Berlin Polytechnic, as the placement of these focuses is a bit odd.
- (Potential) Bugs:
    - Check why France/UK will still declare war on Kuromorimine even after National Spirit Disarmement is removed
    - The image used for the Anschluss (GER_offer_integration_oarai) focus is too large
- 
- 

## Anzio
- Anzio basic Focus tree skeleton:
    - Main democratic focus line that splits into two (we will add more to this) 
        - one for constitutional monarchy 
        - the other for republicanism, which through decision can become a one party democracy or a full blown republic) 
    - communist one which will stay the same.
    - A focus line like the current one based of mussolinis with anchovy with minor changes as well, 
    - pepperonis path through a coup which is alternative fascist with more major changes, 
    - And finally monarchist one with some minor changes
    - Balance of power mechanic will be removed for simplicity
- 


## Balancing
- Add National Spirit to Allied Nations to buff them
    - NOTE: This is a temporary fix until we begin work on some allied focus trees

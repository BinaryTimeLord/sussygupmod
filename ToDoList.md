# To Do List

## Kuromorimine
- National Focuses
    - Finsih all of the democratic branches for Alt-History
    - Add images to National Focuses and Ideas
- Events
    - Make sure all democratic branch events work properly
    - Make sure all Kaiserine events work properly
- Potential Bugs:
    - Check why France/UK will still declare war on Kuromorimine even after National Spirit Disarmement is removed

## Anzio
- Anzio basic Focus tree skeleton:
    - Main democratic focus line that splits into two (we will add more to this) 
        - one for constitutional monarchy 
        - the other for republicanism, which through decision can become a one party democracy or a full blown republic) 
    - communist one which will stay the same.
    - A focus line like the current one based of mussolinis with anchovy with minor changes as well, 
    - pepperonis path through a coup which is alternative fascist with more major changes, 
    - And finally monarchist one with some minor changes
    - Balance of power mechanic will be removed for simplicity
- 
- 
## Balancing
- Add National Spirit to Allied Nations to buff them
    - NOTE: This is a temporary fix until we begin work on some allied focus trees
